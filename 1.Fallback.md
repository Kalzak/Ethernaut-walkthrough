## 1. Fallback
At level 1 we jump straight into reading code to look for potential vulnerabilities. The following steps were taken to find the solution.  
To follow along with the code review please open the ethernaut page and view the level code while reading.
These are the steps that were taken to find the solution.
1. The criteria for passing the level is:
    > you claim ownership of the contract
    
    > you reduce its balance to `0`
    
    So let's start looking through the code and see what we find
2. We immediately see that the way to drain all the balance in the contract is to call the function `withdraw()` as it sends the entire balance to the owner.
    All we have to be able to find now is a way to become the owner
3. There are two ways to become the owner in this contract (excluding the `constructor`)
    1. In the function `contribute()`, if we contribute more than the owner has then we become the contract owner. If we look at the `constructor` we will see that they have contributed 1000 ether. We __could__ send over 1000 ether to `contribute()` but it would require a lot of ether.
    
    2. The contract has a fallback function in-case a user sends ether to the contract directly (the `receive()` function). Looking at the logic in this function we see at the bottom `owner = msg.sender` so if we are able to run the logic inside this function then we can become the owner.
        We just have to be able to pass the 'require` statement which needs our message to have value and that our address has contributions greater than `0`.
4. We can meet the requirements of the `require` statement by contributing ether to the contract, and then sending ether directly to the contract which will call the fallback `receive()` function. 
    - Since we have sent ether to the contract `msg.value` will be greater than `0`.
    - Since we have contributed ether through the `contribute` function our contributions will be greater than `0`.
    At this point we would be the owner of the contract and able to call `withdraw()` to drain the entire balance of the contract.

The commands you would run to exploit the contract would be:
1. Contribute ether through the `contribute()` function
    `contract.contribute({value: toWei('0.0005')})`
2. Send ether to the contract directly to call the `receive()` fallback function
    `sendTransaction({to: contract.address, value: 11111, from: player})`
3. Withdraw all ether in the contract balance
    `contract.withdraw()`
