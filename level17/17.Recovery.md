## 17. Recovery
After dealing with some of the more challenging levels this one felt like a breath of fresh air. All that's needed for this level is etherscan and a simple contract. These are the following steps that were token to solve the challenge:

1. The contract `Recovery` creates a token named `SimpleToken` but we have somehow 'lost' the address of the newly created token. 0.5 ether has been sent to the `SimpleToken` contract and our objective is to recover it. 

2. I'm not sure if my solution is the 'proper' was to complete the challenge but all you need is to put the `Recovery` token in etherscan and have a look at its internal transactions where you will find a contract creation of the `SimpleToken` and its address.

3. `SimpleToken` has a `destroy` function which is designed to release all ether in the contract to the address `_to`. This is a `public` function so it is accessible by anyone. This makes it simple to call. I just made a contract with an interface for `SimpleToken` to be able to call the `destroy` function with an argument of `tx.origin` so the funds will return to me. The code for the contract is in this repo. Once we run the function on the contract the funds return to us!
    Note that on the mainnet something like this would immediately get scooped up by MEV.
