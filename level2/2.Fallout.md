## 2. Fallout
This was quite a simple challenge, but after solving it I learned something new about constructors which I'll bring up. Here are the steps I took to solve the challenge:
1. Our objective is to gain ownership of the contract, so we just look for all places where `owner` can be changed. Through the whole contract only the function `Fal1out()` sets `owner` to `msg.sender`, and it's conveniently a `public` function. 

2. The comment `/* constructor */` above the function mentions that it's a constructor. By why isn't it using the `constructor()` keyword? Well, functions with the same name as the contract are treated as a constructor.
    But if that's the case then we shouldn't be able to call `Fal1out()` anyways because it's still a constructor and that can only be called when the contract is deployed. However if you look closely, you will see that the name of the contract is `Fallout` but the name of the function is `Fal1out`. A `'1'` has been switched with a `'l'`. This means that it's not actually a constructor, but a `public` function that anyone can call!

3. To become the owners of the contract we simply have to run the command `contract.Fal1out()` and _voila!_ We are now the new owners of this contract!
