## 20. Denial
In this level we have to prevent an owner of a contract from being able to receive funds. These are the steps I have taken to solve the challenge:

1. The objective is to stop `owner.transfer()` from running to prevent funds from going to the owner. The first thing to do is have a look at the solidity documentation to see if there are any security concerns that we can take advantage of related to sending ether.

2. By having a read of [this](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/security-considerations.html#sending-and-receiving-ether) we can prevent a payment simply by having a contract with a fallback function that will consume all of the gas in the transaction. As long as the address of the malicious contract is the `partner` then the owner will not be able to withdraw.

3. A simple way to have the fallback function consume all of the gas is to have it run a while loop that will never meet the conditions to exit. The code for this contract is in this repo. All you have to do is deploy the contract, set the partner to the malicious contract address and now whenever `withdraw` is called it will fail (until `partner` is changed).
