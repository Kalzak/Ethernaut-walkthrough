## 4. Telephone
We are given a contract and our objective is to become the owner. This challenge is pretty simple, these are the steps taken to complete the challenge.

1. There is only one function in the contract called `changeOwner()`. Well, it's in the name. The only hiccup is that we can't call this function directly from our own address.
2. There is a check inside the function `tx.origin != msg.sender` that we need to be able to pass. A quick look online will tell you that `msg.sender` is the address that calls `changeOwner()` directly. `tx.origin` on the other hand is the origin of the whole transaction. A good way to think of it is that contracts can call other contracts, but they never __start__ a transaction. Only wallet addresses will ever start transactions because it is initiated by a user. 
3. In order to become the owner, we need to make `tx.origin` different to `msg.sender`. This can be done by having our wallet address call a smart contract, which will then call `changeOwner()`. The source code for this contract is within this repo
4. Once the contract is deployed, we can simple call our contracts function `takeoverTelephone(_targetContract, _newOwner)` and now the address `_newOwner` is the new owner of the contract!
