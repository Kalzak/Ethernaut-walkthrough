## 7. Force
We are given a contract that has no fallback method, no payable functions (or any functions at all for that matter) and we we have to be able to give ether to the contract. Here are the steps that I took to solve the challenge:

1. I had a read of the solidity documentation to see if there is any default fallback function if one isn't manually declared, and I came across this statement under the section on fallback functions:
    > A contract without a payable fallback function can receive Ether as a recipient of a coinbase transaction (aka miner block reward) or as a destination of a selfdestruct.
    > 
    > A contract cannot react to such Ether transfers and thus also cannot reject them. This is a design choice of the EVM and Solidity cannot work around it.
    So we can use `selfdestruct` to send ether to our target contract even though it doesn't have a fallback function or any payable functions.

2. I wrote up a simple smart contract to accept ether and then call `selfdestruct` on a target contract. :The source for this contract is in this repo.

3. Once the contract was written I deployed it, sent ether to the contract and then called the function which runs selfdestruct and I provided our target contract as an argument. Once the transaction was confirmed, you can check on Rinkeby Etherscan and you will see that the target contract will have a balance of whatever you sent to your initial contract!
